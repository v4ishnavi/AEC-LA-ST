# AEC-LA-ST

This repository contains three project reports. 

1) Analog Electronic Circuits- Quadrature Down Converter. Semester 2, UG1, IIIT-H
   This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Quadrature Down Converter, a critical component in modern communication systems, such as WLAN, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. The design incorporates a Quadrature Oscillator, a Switch
   Mixer, and a Low-Pass Filter, enabling effective conversion of high-frequency signals to lower intermediate frequencies. This process minimizes noise in the output, enhancing communication quality. The project also explores practical
   challenges and optimizations in the circuit design, demonstrating its application in wireless receivers and signal processing.

2) Linear Algebra - Leveraging Linear Algebra and Machine Learning in Investment Analysis. Semester 2, UG1, IIIT-H
   This project applied linear algebra and rudimentary machine learning techniques to enhance investment strategy analysis. Using Python, it focused on Mean-Variance Optimization and matrix operations, including multiplication and inversion,
   to evaluate financial models. The project drew on key studies like "Risk-Based Portfolios with Large Dynamic Covariance Matrices" and "Stock Price Prediction Using Regression Analysis" for methodological insights. The primary goals were
   to refine financial decision-making, advance risk assessment methods, and achieve a balanced risk-return ratio in portfolio management. By integrating mathematical approaches with machine learning algorithms, the project offered
   innovative tools for optimizing asset allocation, effectively quantifying risk factors, and constructing comprehensive risk models, thus facilitating more informed and strategic financial planning and investment decisions.
  

3) Systems Thinking - Optimization of Control in a 2-Link Robotic Manipulator Using Advanced Controllers - Semester 3, UG2, IIIT-H
   In the project, advanced control strategies were developed for a 2-link robotic manipulator, focusing on precise position control through torque modulation. The dynamics of the manipulator were modeled using state
   functions and variables, and the control was optimized using PI, PD, and PID controllers to address its complex, non-linear behavior. The project involved simulations in MATLAB-Simulink to validate the effectiveness of these control
   strategies, demonstrating a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application in robotics and control systems. This project can accurately model the working, stability and control of a 2-link robotic arm, as an example.
